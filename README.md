ReadMe For Selenium/Functional Testing

Download and Install FireFox Browser and Selenium IDE.

Open FireFox browser and then open Selenium IDE in the left corner on the window.

Download the HTML Test Cases from our GitHub and open them Selenium IDE
NOTE: 
Some test cases use files/pictures found on our tester environment. You may need to edit code to replace file path to a picture that is found on your desktop environment.

IMPORTANT!!
Change the speed from Fast to Slow in Selenium IDE. Script needs to run slower to be able to grab certain elements in the webpage.

Run the script and enjoy.

NOTE:
Some of the scripts register a new user. You can only run this script once as it will actually register a new user on our server. Make sure to edit the script if you want to run again. Example: Change Rob1@yahoo.com to Rob2@yahoo.com
